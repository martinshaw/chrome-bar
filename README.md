## Why is it not in the Chrome Web Store?

The Chrome Bar is currently in review by Google. It will be available in the Chrome Web Store soon.

## What is the Chrome Bar?

The Chrome Bar is a super-powered command bar for quick keyboard navigation across the internet. It's a Chrome extension that adds a command bar to the bottom-right of your browser window. You can use it to search the web, navigate to websites, and run commands.
