<i>The missing super-powered command bar for quick keyboard navigation across the internet</i> 
</center>

## I want it!

Unfortunately, Chrome doesn't allow you to install extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store by default. If you are having trouble installing the Chrome Bar, try the following:

1. Install Git and Node.js

2. Clone this repository

3. Run `npm install`

4. Run `npm run build`

5. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`

6. Enable `Developer mode` in the top right

7. Click `Load unpacked` in the top left

8. Select the `dist` folder in the cloned repository

9. Press `cmd + cmd` or `ctrl + ctrl` to open the Chrome Bar.

## Why is it not in the Chrome Web Store?

The Chrome Bar is currently in review by Google. It will be available in the Chrome Web Store soon.

## What is the Chrome Bar?

The Chrome Bar is a super-powered command bar for quick keyboard navigation across the internet. It's a Chrome extension that adds a command bar to the bottom-right of your browser window. You can use it to search the web, navigate to websites, and run commands.

## Features

In addition to the main functionality, enabling you to browse the web using the hyperlinks on the page by starting to write part of the link text, the Chrome Bar has a number of other features:

## Future features

There are many new actions I would like to add to the Chrome Bar. I would also like to improve the performance and smoothness of the user experience.
